### Install `vp`

T3 Code uses Vite+ so you'll need to install the global `vp` command-line tool.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
```

#### Windows

```bash
irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex
```

Checkout their getting started guide for more information: https://viteplus.dev/guide/

### Install dependencies

```bash
vp i
```

T3 Cloud is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. To enable it for web, desktop, and mobile source
builds, copy [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to `.env` at the repository root and set the canonical
public configuration there.
